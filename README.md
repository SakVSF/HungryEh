# 1DAndroidAppT4

This is our code for our 50.001 Information Systems and Programming 1D Project.
We've made an app called HungryEh.



### Description

To solve the lack of a system to pre-order food in the SUTD canteen as well as the inability to obtain food related information such as calories and allergy information, we came up with the idea of HungryEh.  
Through HungryEh, we wish to help SUTD students make informed decisions about the type of food they buy, and make the process of ordering food from the SUTD canteen more convenient and less time-consuming. Below are the implementation of the features.

We are Team 2G from CI02.
